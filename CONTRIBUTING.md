# Contributing

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that the official repository is [on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/osakared/sabratha), not github or gitlab. Please see project description to ensure that you are using the correct repository and not a mirror. Pull requests and issues on a mirror will be ignored.

‚ö†Ô∏è All interactions with the project, creating issues, commenting on issues and creating pull requests, must comply with our pretty simple [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

üßúüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è See the sticky on [our official support forum](https://support.tripoli.app/t/project-management-and-milestones/) for guidelines about how we work.

## How to Contribute

There are lots of ways of contributing, even if you don't code or don't feel like working on this codebase! Here are a few ways you can help:

* Use it! Just seeing that people are cloning, starring and following gives us the motivation to spend time on this
* Ask or answer questions and give your feature requests [on our forum](https://support.tripoli.app/)
* Create pull requests with your fixes and enhancements
* [Create and comment on issues](https://codeberg.org/osakared/sabratha/issues)
* Sponsor the maintainer [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tamsynne) or [on github](https://github.com/sponsors/thomasjwebb)
* Tell your friends and colleagues about this repo!

## Issues

Issues are a great place to report bugs and contribute ideas for changes/new features. Just please make sure that your issue isn't redundant. If someone else already submitted the same or very similar issue, please comment that you're having it too, plus any additional details you can provide. Don't worry about being super-thorough. If we can't reproduce it, then we'll ask for additional details as needed.

## Contributing

Please ensure that there's an issue for the bug you're fixing or feature you're implementing. If not, create it. Then create a pull request against the main branch of the official repo. Ensure any new functionality has unit tests on it. Ensure the code you add is in the same style as the file it's in. We use [standard Rust style](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).

Contributions don't have to be to code. Fix and add documentation, `.md` files, etc. If you are changing `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, make sure to make the update in all other repos in the project (Tripoli) as well.
